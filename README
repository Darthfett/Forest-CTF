== About ==

Forest CTF is a Capture the Flag styled game scripted in 'vJass' for Warcraft III - The Frozen Throne.

The game involves two teams of players (1-6 players each team).  Each player chooses a hero with its own unique \
abilities that help the hero fight to retrieve the enemy flag, and bring it back to his base.

With a total of six heroes, the Warrior, Mage, Hunter, Assassin, Rogue, and Paladin, the game has a \
rock-paper-scissors style battle system, with each hero having his own strengths and weaknesses.

The game has its own AI system, and depending upon the game options chosen by the game host, \
it may automatically balance teams, allowing for fun games even in the case of a leaving player.

== Install ==

Place the game file (*.w3x) into the Download folder in the Warcraft III directory (traditionally \
'C:\Program Files\Warcraft III\Maps\Download\').  The game should then be available in the Warcraft III \
maps browser.

== Running the Game ==

Once installed, simply run Warcraft III, and under single player, LAN, or Battle.net Multiplayer, host the \
map as you would any other.
